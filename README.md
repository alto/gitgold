A collection of useful Git console hacks

When I read
[Nicola Paolucci's blog post](http://durdn.com/blog/2012/11/22/must-have-git-aliases-advanced-examples/)
about *Must Have Git Aliases* and all its comments, with all their ideas
and additions, I immediately had the wish to set up a repository which collects all these
hacks, configs and console tipps for
[Git](http://git-scm.com).

So, here we go! Feel free to fork, add your git hacks and send me pull requests. I'm keen to
see all of them!
